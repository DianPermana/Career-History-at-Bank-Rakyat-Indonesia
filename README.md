## Waterfall model ?
this is all the process Software Development Life Cycle. I can say yes waterfall, but no point with methodology or Model. because this is the Oldest & Largest Banking in Indonesia, we have rule from Government Regulations.

Why ? Risk, Rule, Fraud etc. that's is the answer 

ofcouse as QA, this is basic why Must be transformation QA not only as a testing, but also involved for all of the process. just QA understanding if any fraud in the logic code, Functional & Non-Functional PASS or FAILED. BECAUSE WE ARE QUALITY ASSURANCE. we Need to makesure everything meet quality & standarization.

so, this is the beginning where to start. all of these process transformation with  ADLM (Application Development Life Cycle) using JIRA, Bamboo, Bitbucket, Confluence. All process just copy from Manual using this. yes CI/CD, approval and onine documentation. Everthing start from the manual process. because the key is everyone should be understand from the initialization and yes will easy to move to the next Level. so it's about JOURNEY

## Achievement / Research & Development / Design Thinking
- The complexity about the flow is a challenge, everytime we want as fast as posible, but we have rule (Government Regulations). thats why we need strategy to solve all of the process done. we have solution like update parallel document, communication, collaboration, Tips & Trick
- The process testing convert from Manual with Automation : Succesfuly Integration automation test for all system : Core Banking AS400, Cardlink, API, Database, etc
